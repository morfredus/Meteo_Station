# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: The interface sometimes freezes during a weather update. Why?**

**A:** This was a known issue in older versions, especially with an unstable WiFi connection. It was fixed in **version 1.7.0** by adding a network timeout. Please update your firmware. If the problem persists, check your network stability.

**Q: I press a button once, but the screen jumps two pages. How can I fix this?**

**A:** This behavior was caused by the mechanical bounce of the buttons. It was fixed in **version 1.6.0** by introducing a software "debounce" mechanism. Make sure your device is updated.

**Q: Why is the "Alerts" page now always visible in the navigation cycle?**

**A:** Since **version 1.5.0**, the page is always accessible to allow checking the system status at any time. It displays a green shield and "System Nominal" when everything is fine, and switches to the critical alert screen when needed.
